# Calculator
Hello! This is my first JavaScript (JS) project - a simple calculator - using HTML, CSS/SCSS and JS to manipulate the DOM.

At the time of writing, the calculator can only accept an equation with two variables. In addition, the % button produces the modulo of two numbers - i.e. the remainder, if any, when the first variable is divided by the second.

It is my hope to further refine this project to make it more reminiscent of an actual calculator. Any feedback is welcomed! Happy calculating.
